# Pages_Access
User / page admin plugin for Get Simple CMS

Pages Access
Restrict the backend page access of GS to logged in users. Displaying of content would depend on which groups or pages they have been assigned access to. eg: the pages tab would only display a list of pages that they are authorised to see and edit.

Simple use
The plugin use is fairly simple, most of the time it's self explanatory. An example task would be the admin selecting a user and then a page followed by clicking the add or remove button as required. The plugin will also provide warning or success notification when a user conducts a task.

Functions include:
- adding/removing a user to a page
- adding/removing a user to a group
- adding/removing a group to page
Install Instructions:

Download and unzip(unpack) the plugin.

Next place the 'categories' folder into data/other/

Place the folder and file named pages_access into the plugins directory.

Activate the plugin within the plugins tab.

Now navigate to the 'Pages' tab and refresh the browser (F5 on your keyboard).

The new 'pages_access' tab will now appear in the back end. Click on the tab to receive the overview of your pages.

When the plugin first loads it will add the currently logged in user name to the 'admin' array.(This is why we refresh in the pages tab).
